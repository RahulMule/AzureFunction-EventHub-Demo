Sure, I'll incorporate these specific testing and performance evaluation criteria into the **Decision-Making Process** section of the document. I will also add details about auto-scaling in the **Selection Criteria** and **Decision-Making Process** sections to reflect your testing methodology. Here's the revised document with the additional details:

**1. Introduction**
This document outlines the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for selecting App Service Plans within Azure Integration Services, focusing on Azure Logic Apps and Azure Functions. It provides a framework to ensure the selection of the most appropriate App Service Plan based on performance and scalability requirements.

**2. Azure Integration Services Overview**
Azure Integration Services consist of various components including Azure Logic Apps and Azure Functions, which support the automation of workflows and serverless computing needs, respectively.

**3. App Service Plans**
App Service Plans specify the region, VM size, and additional features like scaling and security. The plans range from Free and Shared to more robust offerings like Basic, Standard, Premium, and Isolated.

**4. Selection Criteria**
- **Performance:** The plan must meet the CPU and memory requirements without exceeding 80% utilization under peak load.
- **Scalability:** Evaluate the auto-scaling capabilities, ensuring the plan can dynamically adjust from a minimum of one instance to a maximum of three instances based on the load.

**5. Decision-Making Process**
To select the appropriate App Service Plan, perform the following tests:
- **Test 1:** Low Load - Confirm that the app performs well functionally under the minimum expected load.
- **Test 2:** Average Load - Verify that CPU and memory utilization remain within 80% of capacity during typical load conditions.
- **Test 3:** Maximum Load - Ensure that under maximum expected load, CPU and memory do not exceed 80% utilization.
If any test shows CPU or memory utilization consistently above 80%, move to the next higher plan and repeat the tests. Additionally, monitor how the auto-scaling performs during these tests to ensure that the scaling adjusts correctly between the minimum and maximum instance counts set.

**6. Best Practices**
Regular assessments and adjustments of the App Service Plan are recommended to adapt to changing application demands. Utilize tools like the Azure Pricing Calculator for cost estimates and continuously monitor application performance.

**7. Case Studies**
Illustrative examples where specific App Service Plans were chosen based on the outlined tests and criteria, demonstrating the practical application and benefits of this SOP.

**8. FAQs**
Address common questions regarding plan selection, performance metrics, and scaling features.

**9. Appendix**
Includes a glossary of terms and links to additional resources, such as Azure documentation and pricing calculators.

**10. Revision History**
- **Version 1.1** (April 23, 2024): Added detailed testing and performance evaluation criteria.
